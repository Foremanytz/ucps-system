# Universal Celestial Positioning System (UCPS)

## Description

The Universal Celestial Positioning System (UCPS) is a proposed system designed to provide a standardized and easy-to-use method for expressing locations on the surfaces of known celestial bodies. By integrating NASA/JPL celestial body numbers with a simplified location encoding style similar to Google Plus Codes, UCPS aims to fill the gap in current astronomy and planetary science where a universal location representation is lacking. This system will lay the foundation for cross-body research, mission planning, and future space navigation.

## Usage Instructions

1. Input the celestial body number.
2. Input the latitude and longitude of the location on the celestial body.
3. The system will generate the UCPS coordinates in the format: [Celestial Body Number]:[Plus Code Variant].

## Examples

- Earth (Johnson Space Center): `399:8FXCQ2+X2`
- Moon (Apollo 11 Landing Site): `301:58QFJ2+4V`
- Mars (Curiosity Rover Area): `499:4XP27M+WP`
